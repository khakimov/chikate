Chikate Docs

Comfortable terminals for people who build. Chikate is a tiny TUI toolkit with a bias toward developer happiness: readable APIs, sensible defaults, and clear escape hatches when you need them. These docs are intentionally small, fast to scan, and written in plain English.

Start here
- Getting Started: install, run an example, and draw your first UI — see ./getting-started.md
- Concepts: short, practical explanations of the moving parts — see ./concepts.md
- API: a single, consolidated reference for the things you actually use — see ./api.md
- Guides: focused recipes for real features (selection, input, layout, theming) — see ./guides.md

What to expect
- Small surface area: a few well-factored modules over a sprawling framework.
- Predictable behavior: matching what terminals actually do (mouse, keys, paste, OSC-52).
- Friendly errors and consistent naming to keep the flow.

Tip
- The demo app shows most features in motion. Run: `node chikate/examples/app_demo.js`
